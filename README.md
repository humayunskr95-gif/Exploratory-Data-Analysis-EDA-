# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)

🎯 Objective

The goal of this capstone project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the SCMS Delivery History dataset to:

  - Understand the structure and quality of the data

 -  Identify patterns in shipments, countries, and costs

 -  Detect missing values and data distribution

 -  Derive meaningful business insights from logistics data

##Dataset Overview

- Total records: 10,324

- Total features: 33

- Data types: Numeric + Categorical

- Domain: Supply Chain / Logistics / Healthcare delivery

##Some important columns:

- Country

- Shipment Mode

- Vendor

- Unit Price

- Weight (Kilograms)

- Freight Cost (USD)

- Line Item Quantity

- Manufacturing Site

🔹 Distribution of Freight Cost (USD)

- Highly right-skewed

- Majority of shipments have low freight cost

- Few shipments incur very high costs

📌 Insight: High-cost outliers may be linked to:

- Air shipments

- Heavy weight

- Remote destinations

##Key Insights

- Freight cost does not follow a normal distribution

- Country-wise shipment concentration is uneven

- Missing data is non-trivial and must be handled carefully

- Dataset is suitable for:

- Cost optimization analysis

- Shipment mode comparison

- Country-wise logistics performance

### Key Insights:
- Shipment volume is highest in African countries
- Freight cost shows high variance
- Weight and freight cost are positively correlated
- Missing values exist in dosage and shipment mode

### Conclusion:
This exploratory data analysis reveals strong geographical trends, cost distribution patterns,
and data quality issues. The dataset can be further used for predictive modeling,
cost optimization, and logistics planning.
